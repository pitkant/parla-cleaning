# PLACEHOLDER INPUT DATA

This is a placeholder file. In real world scenario this directory would 
contain "raw" XML files and the folder contents would look like this:

...
Speeches_2000.xml
Speeches_2001.xml
Speeches_2002.xml
Speeches_2003.xml
...

In essence, the file names are the same for raw files and processed files. 
Only way to differentiate them would be to look at which folder they are 
in.
