# PLACEHOLDER DATA

Normally this folder would contain a database file that would contain the 
data needed for running the Shiny application. Ideally this folder would 
contain a single SQLite file but we'll see how things scale. The folder 
structure would look something like this:

FI2000_2014.db

For year 2000-2014 the size of the file is 7,54 GB so we'll see how things 
work out when we take years 1905-1999 and 2015-2023 in the dataset.
